# Scouting
This is an on-going development of the scouting form, by Tarun Dasari, Assistant Programmmer of 
FTC 3846 Maelstrom. This scouting form will be used to scout and record data of matches and send the match data to an another file that organizes everything... At least this is the final goal.
